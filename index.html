Assalamu 'Alaikum!
Alhamdulillah! Assalamu Alaikum!

My name is Al-Ahmadgaid Bahauddin Asaad, I'm a data scientist at DiGenomiX Incorporated, 
a tech-startup company developing health care solutions using deep learning. I'm a statistician by training, 
with Master of Science in Statistics degree from University of the Philippines Diliman. My research was Bayesian 
Autoregressive Distributed Lag via Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, advised by Dr. Magadia (download 
the full copy here). At work, I'm involved on full stack development: from data cleaning, modeling to productization. 
Hence, I've also touched on software development both backend and frontend of the app (for desktop -- using wxPython GUI; 
and web engine -- using electron builder). I'm a heavy user of Python, R, Julia and Javascript (using frameworks such as 
d3.js for interactive visualization) programming languages with experience on C/C++ and Java.

Lastly, I'm a fun of graphic arts and a great supporter of peace.
