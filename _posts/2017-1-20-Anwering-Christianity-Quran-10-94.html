        What is your stand on those verses considering that Jesus (A.S.) is a God in the Bible and in the Qur’an he is a Prophet?

<span class="answer-label">Answer</span><br>
It seems like what you are trying to say is that, we Muslim should refer to the Scriptures revealed before the Qur’an if we are in doubt, and that scriptures are the Torah and the Gospels. The Torah, which is the first part of the Tanakh (the Jewish Bible, also the Old Testament of the Christian Bible), and the Gospel (in the New Testament) are part of the Christian Bible. Then we can conclude that, Jesus is a God since the Qur’an tells us to refer to the Bible, and because the Bible claims Jesus to be God. Did I get your question right? 

Well, let’s look at the context of this verse. What are we talking here in the first place? Let’s check the verses 10:90-94.

10:90

And We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them in tyranny and enmity until, when drowning overtook him, he said, "I believe that there is no deity except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims."


10:91
Now? And you had disobeyed [Him] before and were of the corrupters?


10:92

So today We will save you in body that you may be to those who succeed you a sign. And indeed, many among the people, of Our signs, are heedless


10:93

And We had certainty settled the Children of Israel in an agreeable settlement and provided them with good things. And they did not differ until [after] knowledge had come to them. Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ


10:94

So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.

Therefore, in context the verses 10:90-93 is talking about the Children of Israel during the ruling of the Pharaoh at the time of Prophet Moses (A.S.), you can find the name of Moses (A.S.) in verse 10:88 to verify this. Further, we can conclude that if Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) is in doubt, then Allah commanded him to refer to the previous scriptures to verify this story since he was not present in that event in the first place. In particular, he is referred to the Torah since that is the Book given to Moses (A.S.). Therefore the question is, do we Muslims believe in the Torah and the Gospel? Of course yes, those books were revealed by Allah, and we believe on the prophets from Prophet Adam to Abraham to Moses to John the Baptist to Jesus, and to the last, Prophet Muhammad (May God’s peace and blessings be with them). Let’s look at the verses in the Qur’an to support this claim.







 and since our beloved Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) is not present obviously at the time of our beloved Prophet Moses (A.S.), then 10:94 is telling our Prophet if he is in doubt because he was not present to refer to the previous scriptures to verify this story, right? And what scripture is Allah referring to? Of course not the Gospel but the Torah, because this happened during the time of Prophet Moses (A.S.) and the Torah was given to Moses (A.S.). 

So the next question is, since the Torah is in the Christian Bible, then Jesus is God because that what the Christian Bible teaches, right? The Torah, however, is also the Jewish Bible which was incorporated to the Christian Bible due to the fact that Jesus (A.S.) was a Jew in the first place, right? But the Jew don’t believe in Jesus as God contrary to the Christians. So if we Muslims were told to refer to the Torah, our question is

Who is God referred to in the Torah if the Jews don’t believe in Jesus as God while Christians claims the deity of Jesus? Further, is Jesus in the Torah?

However, we Muslims and the Jews are pure monotheistic, that is we believed in the absolute oneness of God. The Jew refer to the Almighty God as ‘Ela’ which in Arabic is ‘Allah’. Well known rabbis like Rabbi Tovia Singer and Rabbi acknowledge the fact that we pray to the same God; and we Muslim believe on that because that the quran
