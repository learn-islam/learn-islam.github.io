Consider the following verse of the Qur’an:
<div class="quran-wrapper">
    <div class="quran-verse">
        <div class="quran">    
            فَإِن كُنتَ فِى شَكٍّ مِّمَّآ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ فَسْـَٔلِ ٱلَّذِينَ يَقْرَءُونَ ٱلْكِتَٰبَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَقَدْ جَآءَكَ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلَا تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْمُمْتَرِينَ
        </div>
        <div class="translation">
            So if you are in doubt, [O Muhammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.

<div class="answer">
Assalamu `Alaikum! Let me elaborate this question for us to understand the scope of our topic.
The previous scriptures mentioned in the verse refer to the Torah (part of the Jewish Bible) and the Gospels, 
both part of the Christian Bible. From the above verse, it says that if we Muslims are in doubt of the revelations
in the Qur'an, we must therefore refer to the previous scriptures for verification. Further, since
the previous scripture is part of the Christian Bible, then the above question simply states that
we Muslim must acknowledge the deity of Jesus (A.S.) because that's what the Bible says according to the Church.
<p>
    With that in mind, we can say that Jesus (A.S.) plays a pivotal role on the two religions (Islam and Christianity),
    and we can briefly summarize their differences as follows: 
    <div class="question">    
    The trinitarian Christians believe that Jesus (A.S.) is a God and is part of the triune God. They claim that God
    is 3 in 1, that is the God the Father, the God the Son, and the Holy Ghost are all equal and one in essence. On the other hand, we Muslims
    refer to Jesus (A.S.) as prophet and rejects his divinity and the concept of triune God as claimed by the trinitarians. Instead, Muslims
    believe in pure monotheism (absolute oneness of God) just like our Jewish cousines who also believe in the absolute oneness of God.
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    Having laid out the belief of the two parties with regards to Jesus (A.S.), we can now address the question starting with the context of the verse.
    Consider the following verses, 10:88-93:

    Upon reading, we can safely say that in context, Allah (S.W.T.) is referring to the time of Moses (A.S.) during the tyranny of the Pharaoh.
    That is, the previous scriptures being referred in 10:94 is the Torah and not the Gospels. The 10:94, however, can be generalized to accomodate the latter revelation.
    Hence at this point, we need to ask the following question as well:
    <div class="question">    
        Does the Qur'an acknowledges the Torah, the Gospels and all the prophets (from Adam to Abraham, to Noah, to Moses, to Jesus, to Muhammad [may God's peace and blessings be with them all])?
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    The answer is Yes, and we can support this with several verses such as:
</p>
<p>
    At this point, it is already clear from the above evidence that we Muslim acknowledges all previous scriptures given to the prophets.
    The problem is, if we Muslim must refer to the previous scriptures and ask the Christians, they would say that Allah (S.W.T.) is not the only God,
    but rather He is part of the triune God with the inclusion of Jesus (A.S.) and the Holy Spirit. What a huge contradiction! 
    <div class="question">    
        How can Allah (S.W.T.) repeatedly with great warning, explicitly says that He has no partners and is absolutely One in the Quran,
        and yet command us to ask those reading the previous scriptures, in which a party of them (i.e. the Christians) claimed that He is part of the triune God?
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    To answer this question, remember that the Qur'an was revealed after the Bible, and the purpose of this revelation is 
    stated in the following verse:
