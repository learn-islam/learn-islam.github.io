Non-Muslims use the following verses to prove the "Rule of Abrogation", a rule that will justify, accordingly, the contradiction of the verses in the Qur'an:

Thank you very much for this question.
<p>
    As a Muslim, we believe that the Qur'an in its Arabic form is the literal word of Allah (God). Therefore, we need to set a 
    very high standard for this book. It should impress us or at least prove itself to be the best among any other books.
    First and foremost, the very basic assumption, is that, there should be no contradiction. Qu'ran is a holy book that is consistent with the following:
    verses, <a href="https://www.islamreligion.com/articles/5195/some-of-scientific-miracles-in-brief/" target="_blank">scientific discovery</a>,

But, don't fall into what I say, see it for yourself, and put it into test.

    Islam is the religion of Allah (S.W.T.) from the very beginning. Many non-Muslims claim that Islam is a later invention, but it's not, it is the religion of all time.
    To prove that, let's consider the core belief of this religion:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <span>
                One Absolute God. Allah is not a "Muslim God", instead Allah is the almighty God of all human beings. 
                Whoever that one supreme being, that's the Almighty God. Allah simply mean "the one and only true God".
            </span>
        </li> 
        <li>
            <span>
                Muslims (followers of Islam) simply mean "one who submits to the will of the Almighty God".
                Whoever submits all his life to the will of God, he is a Muslim by definition.
            </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Therefore, all prophets send by Allah (S.W.T.) are considered Muslims by definition. 
        That is because all of them submit to the will of Allah (S.W.T.), and all of them teach the absolute oneness of God, from 
        prophet Adam (A.S.) to prophet Moses (A.S.) to prophet Jesus (A.S.) (see John 5:30) and finally to prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.).
    </p>
    <p>
        The revelations of the scriptures where chronologically given to succeeding prophets, and prior to the revelations of the holy Qur'an, Allah (S.W.T.) first revealed the Torah to prophet Moses (A.S.).
        There is no doubt Moses (A.S.) taught the core belief of monotheistic religion, and that is,
        God is absolute in oneness:

        Years after the revelations of the Torah, Allah revealed the Gospels to the children of Israel through prophet Jesus (A.S.). 
        As a Muslim, we believed Jesus (A.S.) was only send to the people of Israel, this is confirmed by Matthew 15:24 (assuming this is indeed a revelation).
        Therefore, at this point, <b>if Allah (S.W.T.) is indeed consistent with His verses, then the foundation of the Gospels must be based on the Torah. 
        Further, if Allah (S.W.T.) is also full of wisdom, then the Gospels must not be identical to the Torah, but rather build on top of it (the Torah), 
        so as to preserve the consistency of the core message of the religion of Allah (S.W.T.)</b>. Indeed, that's exactly what happened, 
        since Jesus (A.S.) used the Torah as his basis for preaching but also include other revelations from Allah (S.W.T.).

        At this point, we can therefore conclude that, the new revelations in the Gospels encompasses the previous revelations as it builds on top of it.
        If you look at the first verse being questioned, it simply says that, the Torah, which we can think of as "old edition" of the holy book, is not abrogated or cause to be forgotten,
        except that Allah (S.W.T.) will bring forth better than it or similar to it, and in this case that would be the Gospels. We can think of the Gospels as "new edition" of the holy book. 
        Again "new edition", in the sense that previous edition are not ignored or abrogated but rather are used as reference since the Gospels and the Torah have similarity but not identical! 
    </p>
    <p>
        Analogously, we can think of the Qur'an as the "latest edition" of the holy books. That is,
        the Qur'an builds its foundation from the previous revelations, the Torah, the Psalms and the Gospels, as confirmed by the following verses:

            Therefore, there is no changing in the words of God. From the very early revelations of Allah (S.W.T.) to prophet Adam (A.S.) to 
            the latest revelation (the final testament -- Qur'an) to prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.), the core message is intact and consistent across time.
            That's why Allah (S.W.T.) said in the Qur'an:
            <div class="quran-wrapper">

        As a conclusion for this section, the verse being questioned is meant to justify that succeeding revelations are builds on top of previous revelations, so as to 
        preserve consistent and therefore no contradiction across revelations as many non-Muslims would say.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, as a Muslim, Allah (S.W.T.) knows best on the true meaning of all the verses He revealed, but we believe in it and there is no contradiction in the Qur'an as Allah (S.W.T.) said:

        Does the Qur'an substitute the previous revelations? To some extent yes, just like how we think of new edition of any Science book,
        it is meant to substitute the old edition, but that doesn't mean the new edition teaches totally different concepts,
        but rather it builds on top of the previous edition. Hence, we can use the previous edition as a reference though it was substituted already by the new edition.
        <b>It's not a contradiction but it's a fact</b>. So we Muslims use the previous revelations as a reference as well, due to the same reasoning, and that is,
        it has the same core message anyways, and Allah (S.W.T.) told us to refer to it to confirm the revelations in the Qur'an:
        <div class="quran-wrapper">

        Verse 16:101 refer to the time when prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) told the people about the new revelations. The 
        Jews don't care anyway if new verse are substituted by another verse in the Qur'an. They only care if the Qur'an will substitute 
        their scriptures. That is why they accused Muhammad (S.A.W.), as quoted explicitly in 16:101 above, saying
        "You, [O Muhammad], are but an inventor [of lies]". This line simply tells us that the above verse is meant to substitute the previous scriptures.

    </div>
    <div class="investigation with-top-border">    
    If you insist in believing verse 2:106 as referring to abrogation of the "Qur'anic verses", then here's a great explanation from <a href="http://www.quran-islam.org/main_topics/quran/false_accusations/abrogation_claims_(P1216).html">True Islam website</a>.
    This is an example of why the original text of the scriptures must be encouraged to have in the holy book. For one main reason, <b>to have a ground truth, because translation miss some of the informations</b>.
    Notice in my posts, I always include the hebrew text of the old testament, and the greek text of the new testament (despite the Christians don't have it by default in almost all of their bibles). This is one of the reason why Muslims recite and study the Qur'an in its Arabic form. 
    Hence, if you happen to ask a Muslim and he says "you need to understand the Qur'an in its Arabic form", then the following will help you understand why.

        The word that we want to give importance is the word "verse" highlighted both in its original Arabic text and in the Saheeh International translation of the Qur'an.
        We Muslim refer to the verses in the Qur'an as Aayah (or Aayat), spelled in Arabic as <span class="quran-inline">آية‎</span> in singular, and <span class="quran-inline">آيات</span> in plural. This is the same Arabic word used in 
        the above verse which is  <span class="quran-inline">ءَايَةٍ</span> (aayatin). You can check the wikipedia of this word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aayah">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The meaning of the word Aayah in the Qur'an is not limited to the word "verse". It could mean the following:

                In some translations, the word signs above is translated as miracles. From the above verse, we have the word Aayah in plural, hence we have this spelling, <span class="quran-inline">ءَايَٰتٍۭ</span> (aayaatim). One might say, it's not the same with the one in Wikipedia in which 
                the plural of Aayah is <span class="quran-inline">آيات</span>. Of course, not exactly but close to it, because the one in Wikipedia is only consonants (no vowels -- these are the small lines, small inverted (x-axis) e, above and below the consonant letters). 
                The Arabic letters are calligraphic, has gender (like Spanish, e.g. library is considered feminine), and has long vowels (that gives the correct pronunciation). These are rules that will guide us on when to use <span class="quran-inline">آية‎</span> (aayat), <span class="quran-inline">ءَايَةٍ</span> (aayatin), <span class="quran-inline">ءَايَةً</span> (aayatan), and <span class="quran-inline">ءَايَٰتٍۭ</span> (aayaatim), all of these are the same. 
                Further, because Arabic letters are calligraphic, the forms does change depending on the preceding and succeeding letters. If you don't believe me, you can check the quran.com specifically <a href="https://quran.com/2/106" target="_blank">here</a> (it has a word to word translation of the above verse).

                </span>
            </li>
        </ol>
        At this point, it should be clear that the word Aayah could mean "sign", "miracle", "evidence", "portent", "token", "example" or "verses" (or "revelations").
        In islam, we treat verses as signs from God. However, the meaning of the word Aayah really depends on the context of the verse as we've seen above.
        For example, in verse 17:101 above, we cannot translate the word Aayah into "verses", since that would translate into:
        <p>
            <div class=question>
                And We had certainly given Moses nine evident <b>verses</b>(?)...
            </div>
        </p>
        While verses are considered signs in Islam, in 17:101, the nine evidence presented to Moses (A.S.) was not literally the verses of the Qur'an, but "miracles". Hence it is not appropriate
        to translate it to "verses" when it's not. The same for 25:37, you cannot translate the word Aayah into "verse", since that would become
        <p>
            <div class=question>
                And the people of Noah - when they denied the messengers, We drowned them, and We made them for mankind a <b>verse</b>(?)... 
            </div>
        </p>
        That would not make any sense if we translate a sign to a verse in the context of 25:37. If we look at 19:10, it is still not applicable since that would sound as follows:
        <p>
            <div class=question>
                [Zechariah] said, "My Lord, make for me a <b>verse</b>." He said, "Your <b>verse</b> is that you will not speak to the people for three nights(???), [being] sound.(???)"
            </div>
        </p>
        Now let's check the verse being questioned, 
        <div class="quran-wrapper">
            <div class="quran-verse">
                <div class="quran">
                    مَا نَنسَخْ مِنْ <span class="emphasize-quran">ءَايَةٍ</span> أَوْ نُنسِهَا نَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ مِّنْهَآ أَوْ مِثْلِهَآ أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ
                </div>
                <div class="translation">
                    We do not abrogate <span class="emphasize">a verse</span> or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?
                </div>  
            </div>
            <div class="verse-no">
                <div class="book">Qur'an</div>
                <div class="chapter">Al-Baqara (The Cow)</div>
                <div class="chapter-verse">2:106</div>
            </div>  
        </div>
        If we translate it into "a verse" (excluding other meanings), then that would not make any sense.
        Why?
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span>
                    Because the words "<b>cause to be forgotten</b>" could not be applicable if the word "Aayah" in this verse meant a verse in the Qur'an. How can a verse in the Qur'an become forgotten? For even if the verse was invalidated by another 
                    (as the interpreters falsely claim) it will still be part of the Qur'an and thus could never be forgotten.
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                    The words "<b>We replace it with that which is better than it or similar to it</b>" would be meaningless if the word "Aayah"
                    in this verse meant a Quranic verse, simply because it would make no sense for God to invalidate one verse then replace it with one that is similar to it!
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                    If the word "Aayah" in verse 2:106 meant a miracle, an example, an evidence, a portent, or a sign, then all the words of the verse would make perfect sense. 
                    The words "cause to be forgotten" can apply to all other meanings except for Qur'anic verses, and that is what actually happened with the passing of time. 
                    The miracles of Moses (A.S.) and Jesus (A.S.) have long been forgotten. We only believe in them because they are mentioned in the Quran.
                </span>
            </li>
        </ol>
        Similarly, the words "We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it" are in line with the miracles of God. God indeed replaces one miracle with its equal or with one that is greater than it. Consider the following verse:
        <div class="quran-wrapper">
            <div class="quran-verse">
                <div class="quran">

        The word abrogation can refer to lifting of rules such as the change in the direction (qiblah) of our prayers, back then when Muslims pray they face the direction of the 
        Jerusalem. Although there is no verse saying that we need to face Jerusalem, but that was the ruling before. Then afterwards, Allah (S.W.T.)
        change the direction to Makkah for the following reasons (until today all Muslims face the direction of Makkah as part of unity):

In this verse, we can see how the word verse take different forms in one sentence, we have the first one spelled as <span class="quran-inline">ءَايَةً</span> ("ayatan") and the second mentioned of the 
word is spelled as <span class="quran-inline">ءَايَةٍ</span> ("ayatin"). This is an evidence of what I mentioned above, that Arabic word composition has rules.

    The substitution above refers to one of two things:

                Here we have the Qur'an supersedes the previous scriptures, so the question now is: <b>am I saying that the Qur'an substitutes the previous revelations or scriptures</b>? 
                Of course not, but as a criterion over it. See, we Muslims believe in the revelations of the Gospels to Prophet Jesus (A.S.) and the revelations to Moses (A.S.),
                but does the Qur'an substitute it? No, but instead Allah (S.W.T.) gives us something similar or better than it. These ruling of course does not change the core teachings of Jesus (A.S.) and Moses (A.S.), 
                and all prophets, which is the oneness of Allah (S.W.T.). The reason why the Qur'an becomes a criterion now is due to the fact that previous revelations is now difficult to verify. 
                Most bible nowadays being sold and studied by ordinary Christians don't even have the original Hebrew or Greek texts to verify the translations. 
                Further, it is also difficult for us Muslims to believe in the bible, because most Christians scholars are not united, some believe Jesus is God or some not, due to the concept of trinitarian and unitarian.
                In order to protect us, we Muslims have been clearly warned by Allah (S.W.T.) about the previous scriptures:

    In this article, I've shown you the explanation and analyses of the verses being questioned to the best I can. 
    However, as a Muslim, Allah (S.W.T.) knows the best meaning of these verses. There may be ambiguous verses in the Qur'an,
    but what is important is that the foundation of our belief must be consistent with all previous scriptures.
    Allah (S.W.T.) clearly stated this in the following verse below:
