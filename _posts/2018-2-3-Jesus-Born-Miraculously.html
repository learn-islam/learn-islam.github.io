Jesus' (A.S.) miracles are also depicted in the Qur'an, such as speaking as an infant, healing sickness, raising dead to life, and bringing life by breathing on a clay.

<div class="answer">
    Assalamu `Alaikum! Before we proceed I'd like to point out, that the above question also attempts to answer one (the miraculous birth of Jesus (A.S.)) of the questions in this post, you can check it if you are interested.
    <p>
        In order to understand the question, we need to agree first on the belief of our trinitarian brothers with regards to the miracles done by Jesus (A.S.).
        <div class="question">
            The trinitarian believes that Jesus (A.S.) was born miraculously by the virgin Mary, and that he performed several miracles during his lifetime, and they used these among others as
            their proofs that Jesus (A.S.) is a God.
        </div>
    </p>
    Their claim about the miraculous birth can be supported with the following Bible verses:
    <div class="bible-wrapper">
        <div class="bible-verse">
            <div class="bible">    
                τοῦ δὲ ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ ἡ γένεσις οὕτως ἦν. μνηστευθείσης τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ μαρίας τῶ ἰωσήφ, πρὶν ἢ συνελθεῖν αὐτοὺς εὑρέθη ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχουσα ἐκ πνεύματος ἁγίου.
            </div>
            <div class="translation">
                Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.

        These verses are just part of the detailed discussion on the birth of Jesus (A.S.), in fact among the four Gospels, the most detailed description of this miraculous birth is depicted in the book of Luke.
        However, these miracles did not just end at his birth, instead it propagated as he grew up where he performed several miracles to the Children of Israel, and we can find these in several places of the Gospels in the Bible.
        Some of these are listed in the table below.

        The above list is nothing new to our Christian brothers, but what is interesting to both of us (Christians and Muslims) is what the Qur'an says about these miracles.
        <div class="question">
            Do we Muslims believe in the miracles done by Jesus (A.S.)?
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        The answer to that is it depends. It depends on how you look at it. If you say Jesus (A.S.) did these miracles with his own powers, then we Muslims don't believe on that.
        However, if you say Jesus (A.S.) made these miracles through the power of the one who send him -- Allah (S.W.T.), then absolutely Yes.
    <p>
        In preparation for our discussion below, we need to understand as well what is the purpose of the Qur'an, since we know the fact that it was revealed after the previous scriptures (i.e. the Torah, the Gospels -- the Bible).
        The purpose of the revelation of the Qur'an is explained in the following verses:
        <div class="quran-wrapper">

        According to Allah <span class="tooltip">(S.W.T.)<span class="tooltiptext">Subhanahu wa ta'ala, Arabic for "May He be glorified and exalted", Muslim honorific.</span></span>, the Qur'an was revealed as a <b>criterion</b> over the previous scriptures. That is, we must use the Qur'an to verify if such revelation is <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>. For example, according to the new testament
        of the Christian bible, it says that God has taken a son, but the Qur'an rejects this.
        <div class="quran-wrapper">

        </div>
        Notice how the verse commenced, "They have said ...". This phrase simply proves how Qur'an looks at the previous scriptures, it tries to confirm and correct the mistakes done, because obviously we were not alive in that time,
        and as the verse states "... Do you say about Allah that which you do not know?". This is also to counter the argument made by the trinitarians, that if <i>the previous scripture is wrong and the Qur'an confirms those scriptures, then the Qur'an is also wrong</i>.
        </p>
        Let's open the Qur'an and see what does it says regarding this topic.
