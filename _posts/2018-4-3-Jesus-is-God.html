The life of Jesus (A.S.) plays a pivotal role to both Christianity and Islam. 
The two religions believe Jesus (A.S.) as the Messiah send by Allah (God) to the children of Israel.
His divinity is the core belief of the majority of the Christian denominations around the world,
but is rejected by the Qur'an (the holy book of Islam). So the main question is,

    Assalamu 'Alaikum! Let me begin by praising the Almighty God, the creator of everything.

    <h2>Trinity</h2>
    In this section, we'll discuss the doctrine of Trinity which is taught by majority of the churches around the world.
    <p>
        <div class="with-left-border">
            According to Christianity, God is three persons in one essence. Specifically, the three persons are the Father, the Son (who accordingly is Jesus (A.S.)), and the Holy Spirit.
            They are all God, equal in power, and one in essence.
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to understand the doctrine, it is best to visit the history as to how the word "trinity" came to surface.
        The following table summarizes the history of the trinity taken from the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/trinity-history.html" target="_blank">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>.
        <table>

                        their source, the one God, that is, the Father. One may also call this theology unitarian, 
                        in the sense that the one God just is the Father, and not equally the Son and Spirit, so 
                        that the one God is "unipersonal". [1]</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="text-align:center;">Tertullian<br>(ca. 160-225)</td>
                    <td style="text-align:center;">trinity</td>                    
                    <td>Against the common believers concerned with monotheism, Tertullian argues ... it does not introduce two 
                        more gods - not gods in the sense that Yahweh is a god. There is still, as there can only be, 
                        one ultimate source of all else, the Father. Thus, monotheism is upheld. ... 
                        Tertullian holds that the Son is "ignorant of the last day and hour, which is known to the Father only."<br><br>
                        Despite these fundamental differences from later orthodoxy, Tertullian is now hailed by 
                        trinitarians for his use of the term “Trinity” (Latin: trinitas) and his view that it 
                        (at the last stage) consists of three persons with a common or shared "substance". [1]</td>
                </tr>

        I highly recommend you visit the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/trinity-history.html" target="_blank">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>
        for the complete picture of the event on the development of the trinitarian doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the history itself, we found out that before there was trinity, early christians adhere to the concept of unitarian.
        That the Father, Yahweh, is the only true God, until Tertullian proposed the doctrine of trinity, making Jesus (A.S.) God as well.
        <div style="display:block;height:5px;"></div>
    </p>
    <h3>Common Trinitarian Argument</h3>
    The doctrine of the trinity has long been debated ever since it was proposed by Tertullian. The Christians themselves are not
    united in this doctrine, some rejects this and pursued the concept of unitarian.
    <p>
        As a Muslim, an outsider coming from a different religion, the doctrine of trinity is really hard to understand. Here's the typical questions I have for this,
        <ul>
            <li><span>If trinity is the core belief of Christianity, why was it not taught by Jesus (A.S.) in the Gospel?</span></li>
            <li><span>If trinity was not taught by Jesus (A.S.), why is it being taught by the Churches?</span></li>
        </ul>
        Now let me discuss my first question above, the common argument by the trinitarian is that, while the word "trinity"
        or the phrase "God is three persons in one essence ..." is not in the bible (just like the word "bible" not found in the bible), 
        the general message being conveyed by the new testament, accordingly, pictures the three persons (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit) 
        coming together as to imply trinitarian doctrine. For example the following verses bring together the three persons of the godhead. [2]

        </div>
        Other verses are the following: Romans 14:17-18; 15:16; 1 Corinthians 2:2-5; 6:11; 12:4-6; 2 Corinthians 1:21-22; Galatians 4:6; Ephesians 2:18-22; 3:14-19; 
        Ephesians 4:4-6; Colossians 1:6-8; 1 Thessalonians 1:3-5; 2 Thessalonians 2:13-14; and Titus 3:4-6.
    </p>
    <p>
        The above verses according to the Christians imply trinitarian doctrine. [2] While these verses depict the three persons coming together,
        it's not a concrete proof that God is three persons in one since it does not say that, instead you have to look at it as implied. 
        If that is the case, one should be very careful and investigate the scriptures and see the general message being conveyed, that is because trinity is implied.
        Implied in the sense that if a unitarian christian would investigate those verses, he would likely have another implied interpretation.
        According to the doctrine of the trinity, the three persons are Gods and are all equal. 
        Hence Jesus (A.S.) would then be omniscient, omnipotent and posseses the quality of God. Let's look at the bible, and see my questions below:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                    If Jesus (A.S.) is God, then he is omniscient. If he is omniscient, then why is it he is ignorant of the time of his return?

                    Isn't it very risky to add a partner to the Father for He is a jealous God? And if you do so, He would be anger that He wants you to be destroyed off from the face of the earth?

                                And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well,

                                And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.

                                And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself,

                    Shouldn't Jesus (A.S.) reject the oneness of God, and instead clarify that God is part of the trinity? 
                    The <i>shema</i> which is the phrase "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one"
                    is the core belief of Jews, and they recite this several times in a day on their prayers. 
                    In Islam this is equivalent to <i>kalima</i> which is the most powerful phrase in Islam, and this is the calligraphy written in the Saudi Arabian flag.
                    The phrase is: "There is no god but Allah (God)". Some Christian apologists argue that the word "one" in the shema is a complex unity, and I will reserve my discussion on that in another section.
                    The fact that Judaism and Islam are praying to the same one God, and that Jesus (A.S.) is a jew, shouldn't we worship his God alone?

                    The christians often say that, no one can uphold the law in the ten commandments because all us are sinners.
                    While this is true that we are all sinners, but is it difficult to uphold the oneness of God in the first commandment?

                    According to christians, God does not change as in Malachi, that is, he keeps his promise. So when He said that sins will be forgiven through sacrifice (He never said only).
                    Why would God then never kept his promised when Jesus (A.S.) needs him the most as he was affraid of dying? In Psalms 91, God promised Jesus (A.S.) to be saved and protected.

                    If the Father is so loving and merciful, how can he let his son die for the sins of humanity? Why can't he just forgive us if we want to repent?

                    The christians often say that God died for our sins, or for my sins. If he died, how can God die? And who is now in charge of the world if there is no God when Jesus (A.S.) died?
                    Isn't that very risky to say, since that would make it a blasphemy?

                    Some would argue that, God did not die but only the human part of him. So my question is, why would the christian say that God died for my sins in the first place when he did not die anyway?
                    Further, if the human part died, then the trinity does not hold any more.
