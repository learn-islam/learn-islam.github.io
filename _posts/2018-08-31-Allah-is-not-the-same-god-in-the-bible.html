Non-Muslims claim that Allah <span class="tooltip">(S.W.T.)<span class="tooltiptext">Subhanahu wa ta'ala, Arabic for "May He be glorified and exalted", Muslim honorific.</span></span> is not the same God referred to in the bible by Moses <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span> , Jesus <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>  and other prophets mentioned in the Bible.

    <span class="tooltip">Assalamu 'Alaikum!<span class="tooltiptext">Arabic for "Peace be upon you", Muslim greeting.</span></span>
    <span class="tooltip">Alhamdulillah!<span class="tooltiptext">Arabic for "Praise be to God", Muslim common phrase.</span></span> 
    <p>
        Historically, Islam builds its foundation from previous revelations (see my discussion from my <a href="https://learn-islam.github.io/answering/christianity/qur'an/al-baqara/an-nahl/yunus/2:106/16:101/2018/08/25/Quranic-Abrogation.html" target="_blank">previous article</a>), the Torah and the Gospels. Therefore, 
        it should be straightforward for us Muslims to believe that, the God referred to by Moses <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>  and Jesus <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>, in the previous revelations, is the same God referred to in the Qur'an.
        <!-- That is, if indeed the bible contains the authentic revelations given to prophets Moses <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>  and Jesus <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span> , then 
        there is no question on the difference, since both must be the same. -->
    <!-- </p>
    <p> -->
        However, as you noticed, we Muslims have reservations, we don't really know how authentic are the revelations in the bible, that is,
        we don't know which verse is indeed a true revelation. What we are (Muslims) sure of, 
        is that the religion preached by Moses <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>  (see Deuteronomy 6:4) and Jesus <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>  (see Matthew 5:17-19 and 17:3, see my <a href="https://learn-islam.github.io/answering/christianity/qur'an/al-baqara/an-nahl/yunus/2:106/16:101/2018/08/25/Quranic-Abrogation.html" target="_blank">previous article</a> for more details
        on why Moses <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>  and all prophets are Muslims) refers to one absolute supreme being, and that is the Almighty God, that is Allah <span class="tooltip">(S.W.T.)<span class="tooltiptext">Subhanahu wa ta'ala, Arabic for "May He be glorified and exalted", Muslim honorific.</span></span>.  
        Hence, any bible verses referring to the absolute oneness of God is indeed lovely to us Muslims.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's investigate how Moses <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>, Jesus <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>, and prophet Muhammad <span class="tooltip">(S.A.W.)<span class="tooltiptext">Ṣalla llāhu ʿalay-hi wa-alehe-wa-sallam, Arabic for "May Allah honour him and grant him peace", Muslim honorific.</span></span> refer to God, 
        etymologically (the study of the origin of words and the way in which their meanings have changed throughout history).
        Starting with the name of God in Arabic, and its comparison to Hebrew (the language of Moses <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>) and Aramaic (the language of Jesus <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>). After that, we'll look at the concept of God 
        in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

    <div class="investigation with-top-border">  
        It would be better to understand the difference if we know the meaning of the arabic name of God, Allah.
        The name Allah is written in Arabic as <span class="quran-inline">الله</span>. It is composed of the following letters:
        <table>
            <thead>
                <td>Arabic Letter</td>
                <td>Name</td>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td align="center"><span class="quran-inline">ا</span></td>
                    <td align="center">Alif</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td align="center"><span class="quran-inline">ل</span></td>
                    <td align="center">Lam</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td align="center"><span class="quran-inline">ل</span></td>
                    <td align="center">Lam</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td align="center"><span class="quran-inline">ه</span></td>
                    <td align="center">Hah</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        The letters above are all consonants. The vowels are formed by what we call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_diacritics" target="_blank">tashkil</a> (these are the small lines above and below the consonant letters), and 
        the complete form of the name with the vowel is <span class="quran-inline">اَللّٰهْ</span>. The name Allah refers to "one and only true God".

        The old testament is the Jewish bible originally written in Hebrew (the language of Moses <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>) and some Aramaic (e.g. the book of Ezra. Aramaic is the language of Jesus <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>), a semetic language with close similarity to 
        Arabic (the language of prophet Muhammad <span class="tooltip">(S.A.W.)<span class="tooltiptext">Ṣalla llāhu ʿalay-hi wa-alehe-wa-sallam, Arabic for "May Allah honour him and grant him peace", Muslim honorific.</span></span>). The name Allah if spelled in Hebrew is <span class="bible-hebrew-inline">אללה</span>,
        composed of the following consonant letters:
        <table>
            <thead>
                <td>Hebrew Letter</td>
                <td>Name</td>

            <tbody>
                <tr>

                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        or in English, <span class="bible-hebrew-inline">א</span> is equivalent to <b>A</b> as consonant (a placeholder for the following sounds: "a", "e" or "i", "o" or "u");
        <span class="bible-hebrew-inline">ל</span> is equivalent to letter <b>L</b>; and <span class="bible-hebrew-inline">ה</span> is equivalent to letter <b>H</b>.
        If we remove one <span class="bible-hebrew-inline">ל</span> (lamed) above, then we have <span class="bible-hebrew-inline">אלה</span>, which in Hebrew is "God".
        Of course, one might argue that these letters can also refer to "curse" in Hebrew, since there are seven letters in Hebrew that uses the three ordered consonant 
        letters -- <span class="bible-hebrew-inline">אלה</span>, and two of it are "curse" and "God".
        Moreoever, like the tashkil of Arabic for vowels, Hebrew uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqqud" target="_blank">niqqud</a> (dots above and below the consonant letters) for vowels. So that the spelling of "curse" in Hebrew is 
        <span class="bible-hebrew-inline">אָלָה</span>, and the complete spelling of "god" in Hebrew is <span class="bible-hebrew-inline">ַאֱלֹה</span>.
        Through etymology, the name of God in Hebrew is based on the three letters: <span class="bible-hebrew-inline">אלה</span>.
         <p>
            On the other hand, God in Arabic is also called "ilah" spelled as (with vowels) <span class="quran-inline">اِلَهْ</span>&nbsp;, composed of the following consonant letters:
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <td>Arabic Letter</td>

            </table>
            which in Hebrew is equivalent to <span class="bible-hebrew-inline">אלה</span>. Though there are differences on the style of the scripts, the letters used are the same.
            Therefore, etymologically, the word God in Hebrew and in Arabic is the same.

        You can confirm this at <a href="http://www.atour.com/cgi-bin/dictionary.cgi?string=god&Search_Field=Meaning" target="_blank">Aramaic Lexicon and Concordance</a> by entering "God" in the query.
        Therefore, Jesus <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>  referred to God as "Aalah" which is close to Allah. I think this should be no surprise since Arab Christians use the name "Allah"
        to refer to God. However, we should be clear that we Muslims and Christians don't refer to the same God as discussed in the next section.
        <!-- <p>
            For us Muslims, we believe that the God referred to by Moses <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>  and Jesus <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>  is the same God referred to by prophet Muhammad <span class="tooltip">(S.A.W.)<span class="tooltiptext">Ṣalla llāhu ʿalay-hi wa-alehe-wa-sallam, Arabic for "May Allah honour him and grant him peace", Muslim honorific.</span></span>. However, we need to be clear that
            Christians do not refer to the same God referred to by Muslims and Jews. Since Muslims and Jews refer to one absolute being,
            while the Christians refer to God as triune God in order to account the deity of Jesus <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span> . As a Muslim, I attest that the God prayed to by Jews 
            is the same God we pray to, and I'll discuss this in the next section
        </p> -->
        <p>
            <b>As a conclusion for this section, the name Allah in Arabic, is indeed God in Hebrew and Aramaic. This is in contrary to the claims by other non-Muslims that Allah is a moon God or a curse God (from the Hebrew word <span class="bible-hebrew-inline">אָלָה</span>) or devil, I think that is just nonsense.
            As a Muslim, taught to respect all religions, we should not propagate false information.
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Does Judaism, Christianity, and Islam then have the same concept of God?

    </div>
    <div class="investigation-wrapper">
        <span class="investigation-label">Concept of God in Judaism, Christianity, Islam</span>
    </div>
    <div class="investigation with-top-border">  
        While we have proven (through etymology) the similarity of the word God in three languages, we also need to confirm its consistency with the concept of God taught in the 
        three religions. I think it should be clear that, among the three religions, only Islam and Judaism pray to the same one absolute being (pure monotheism), while Christianity pray to a triune God to accommodate the deity of Jesus <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span> .
        <p>
            <b>Therefore, what we need to hear at this point, is the evidence of our Christian brothers to prove that Moses <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>  did indeed pray to a triune God.
            We understand that our Christian brothers claim that the old testament is the fulfillment of the diety of Jesus <span class="tooltip">(A.S.)<span class="tooltiptext">ʿAlayhi as-salām, Arabic for "Peace be upon him", Muslim honorific.</span></span>, but as a Muslim, I want to 
            see proofs for that claim.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            I will let the Jews to speak about Judaism, Christianity, and Islam on topics like the concept of God, and similarity and differences (all of these 
            videos are maintained by Jews and not by Muslims):
