In this blog post, I would like to discuss the purpose of the revelation of the Qur'an, and
answer some of the misconceptions about it. All of us would agree that the Qur'an was revealed later after the revelation of the previous scriptures
(i.e. the Torah, the Gospels both part of the Christian Bible).

            شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أُنزِلَ فِيهِ ٱلْقُرْءَانُ هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَٰتٍ مِّنَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْفُرْقَانِ فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ ٱلشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ وَمَن كَانَ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُمُ ٱلْيُسْرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ ٱلْعُسْرَ وَلِتُكْمِلُوا۟ ٱلْعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا هَدَىٰكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ

            The month of Ramadhan [is that] in which was revealed the Qur'an, <span class="emphasize">a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion</span>. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that [to] which He has guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful.

            And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, <span class="emphasize">confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion</span> over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good. To Allah is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.

According to Allah <span class="tooltip">(S.W.T.)<span class="tooltiptext">Subhanahu wa ta'ala, Arabic for "May He be glorified and exalted", Muslim honorific.</span></span>, the Qur'an was revealed as a <b>criterion</b> over the previous scriptures. That is, we must use the Qur'an to verify if such revelation is <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>. For example, according to the new testament
of the Christian bible, it says that God has taken a son, but the Qur'an rejects this.

            They have said, "Allah has taken a son." Exalted is He; He is the [one] Free of need. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. You have no authority for this [claim]. Do you say about Allah that which you do not know?

Notice how the verse commenced, "They have said ...". This phrase simply proves how Qur'an looks at the previous scriptures, it tries to confirm and correct the mistakes done, because obviously we were not alive in that time,
and as the verse states "... Do you say about Allah that which you do not know?". This is also to counter the argument made by the trinitarians, that if <i>the previous scripture is wrong and the Qur'an confirms those scriptures, then the Qur'an is also wrong</i>.
