Whereas the God of the Qur'an brings about both good and evil, the God of the Bible never engages in evil and is singularly righteous (1 John 1:5).

    Is the above statement true?

    <span class="tooltip">Assalamu 'Alaikum!<span class="tooltiptext">Arabic for "Peace be upon you", Muslim greeting.</span></span>
    <span class="tooltip">Alhamdulillah!<span class="tooltiptext">Arabic for "Praise be to God", Muslim common phrase.</span></span> 
    <p>
        If we are to interpret the above statement, it seems to suggest that the God of the Qur'an is not righteous since it also brings evil to 
        human beings. If that's what you believed, then let's investigate the Qur'an if such statement is true.
    </p>
    <p>
        God by definition should be loving and caring, and <b>should never bring forth evil to His creation</b>. However, God by definition is <b>the creator of everything</b>. Hence, <b>God created Satan as well</b>.
        Anything evil is of course from Satan and not from God. Further, if God indeed loves us, then He should clearly warned us of Satan and give us reason 
        why He created Satan in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Islam, everything around us is well-planned and well-designed according to the will of Allah (S.W.T.), 
        from the very start of creation. So any decision we do is NOT A COINCIDENCE, Allah (S.W.T.) knows ahead of time what our actions would be.
        However, in Islam, despite the decisions we made somehow are already programmed, we are also told that, 
        we have our OWN FREE WILL in our decision making. At first glance, there seems to be conflict
        since NOT A COINCIDENCE and WITH FREE WILL are better interpreted as mutually exclusive. But, 
        that is indeed possible, in which our FREE WILLED decisions end up to what God actually planned. 
        To have the two (NOT A COINCIDENCE and WITH FREE WILL) to work well together, is one reason why Allah (S.W.T.) is the one and only true God,
        because those attributes are difficult to maintain or even easy to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having the above understanding, it suffices to say that Allah (S.W.T.) brings forth goodness to us and not evil, since it is up to us whether to 
        follow Allah (S.W.T.) or to follow Satan. Whatever our decisions may be, it is, by design, our own free will. If we follow Allah (S.W.T.), then goodness is indeed from Him. However,
        if we follow Satan, then there is no goodness in it, and <b>the absence of goodness is evil</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        While we believe evil is from Satan, we also argued above that God created him in the first place. Therefore technically, everything 
        we received is indeed from the will of Allah (S.W.T.) even those from the works of Satan. But what is the reason behind it?
        How can a loving and caring God create evil for us human beings? In Islam, Allah (S.W.T.) created evil <b>as a test</b>.
        Otherwise, if there is no test (such as the presence of evil), then what is the point of having heaven and hell?
        Indeed, Allah (S.W.T.) created the heaven and hell for those who deserve it. In order to determine who qualified for heaven or hell, there should be a 
        way to segment human beings into groups belonging to heaven or hell.
        So how does universities choose their students? What do they do to determine those who qualified?
        They tests us right? Remember those entrance tests? That's how they do it. Therefore, applying the same analogy, Allah (S.W.T.) tests us as well in order for him to tag (though Allah (S.W.T.) knows this already)
        those who follow Satan and those who follow Him. However, unlike the approaches done by the universities, Allah (S.W.T.), the Most Merciful, already told us
        the answer to all tests, and that is, to trust Him and follow Him only, and not Satan who is our clear enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, in Islam, goodness is not always a blessing for those having weak faith. Sometimes, Allah (S.W.T.) tests us with goodness by giving us power and wealth.
        If you have weak faith, you will likely fail in this test, since there are lots of temptations (evil things like night clubs, drugs, etc.) one would likely fall into. Satan constantly whispers and do suggestions that even goodness can turn into evil.
        Hence, good can be evil in disguise if you have weak faith, and what you thought as evil can be a blessing in disguise (say poverty which you might consider as evil, is actually a blessing in disguise because you are constrained
        to what you have, and not be able to go for bar/drugs/etc. that rich guys are sometimes tempted to do).
        So don't rush and conclude that Allah (S.W.T.) brings forth evil through Satan, because in the end,
        Satan has his own free will, his decision is his own and not influenced by Allah (S.W.T.) (though Allah (S.W.T.) knows already the actions of Satan ahead of time).
    </p>
    <p>
        The above discussion is enough to conclude that such statement, that Allah (S.W.T.) brings forth evil, is not true. Feel free to counter my argument if you disagree.
        What left for me then, is to dump the verses as proofs to the above logic.

2|44|Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason?
6|38|And there is no creature on [or within] the earth or bird that flies with its wings except [that they are] communities like you. We have not neglected in the Register a thing. Then unto their Lord they will be gathered.
11|6|And there is no creature on earth but that upon Allah is its provision, and He knows its place of dwelling and place of storage. All is in a clear register.


35|11|And Allah created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop; then He made you mates. And no female conceives nor does she give birth except with His knowledge. And no aged person is granted [additional] life nor is his lifespan lessened but that it is in a register. Indeed, that for Allah is easy.
36|12|Indeed, it is We who bring the dead to life and record what they have put forth and what they left behind, and all things We have enumerated in a clear register. -->

                    The Bible as the christians claimed is inspired by God (2 Timothy 3:16-17). That is, all verses in the Bible 
                    must therefore be considered holy. Holy words therefore must be announced or preached to all human beings.
                    If that is the case, then the pastors or priests or any christians must preached these verses to their children,
                    to their sister, to their wife, to their mother and all members of the family, and also including the non-Christians, because all of these are inspired by God.

                                The <span class="emphasize">word of the Lord came again unto me</span>, saying, Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother: 
                                And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their <span class="emphasize">breasts pressed</span>, and 
                                there they <span class="emphasize">bruised the teats of their virginity</span>. And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: 
                                and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah. 
                                And Aholah played the <span class="emphasize">harlot when she was mine</span>; and  <span class="emphasize">she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours</span>, Which were 
                                clothed with blue, captains and rulers, <span class="emphasize">all of them desirable young men</span>, horsemen riding upon horses. Thus <span class="emphasize">she committed 
                                her whoredoms with them</span>, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and <span class="emphasize">with all on whom she doted</span>: with all 
                                their idols she defiled herself. Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, 
                                and <span class="emphasize">they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her</span>. Wherefore I have delivered her into 
                                the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted. <span class="emphasize">These discovered her nakedness</span>: they took her 
                                sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon 
                                her. And when her sister Aholibah saw this, <span class="emphasize">she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she</span>, and in her whoredoms more 
                                than her sister in her whoredoms. <span class="emphasize">She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours</span>, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, 
                                horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men. Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way, 
                                And that <span class="emphasize">she increased her whoredoms</span>: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed 
                                with vermilion, Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look 
                                to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity: <span class="emphasize">And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, 
                                she doted upon them</span>, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. And the Babylonians came to her <span class="emphasize">into the bed of love, and 
                                they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them. So she 
                                discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated 
                                from her sister</span>. Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had 
                                played the harlot in the land of Egypt. For she doted upon their paramours, whose <span class="emphasize">flesh is as the flesh of asses</span>, and whose 
                                <span class="emphasize">issue is like the issue of horses</span>. Thus thou calledst to remembrance the <span class="emphasize">lewdness of thy youth</span>, 
                                in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.

                    Succeeding discussions are sensitive and I apologize, but I don't have the intention of offending Christianity. 
                    <p>
                        There are many other verses in the Bible that depicts sexual scenes that are not suitable for women and children, like Ezekiel 16:25, Song of Songs 4:10-12, etc. Some are listed <a href="https://www.therichest.com/shocking/15-naughty-verses-you-wont-believe-came-from-the-bible/" target="_blank">here</a>,
                        just do google and you'll find more reference about it. I think, if God gives us verses of adulterous women as an example to be avoided, then there is no need to detail sex related scenes like in the above verses.
                        Why would God even describe the male private part and its likeness to asses, and the issue or emission of it in the likeness of that of horses? "... <b>whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses</b>", what is the purpose of that line?
                        What is the holy hidden message in these verses? Some translation like NIV of the Ezekiel 23:20-21 is read as follows:

                    As a Muslim, I respect any religion (that include Christianity), but to accuse Allah (S.W.T.) as bringer of evil, then I think the christians 
                    must explain the holiness of the above verses to their wife, sister, mother, and children. I, also, want to know it since it is inspired by God as 2 Timothy 3:16-17 claimed.

    <span class="investigation-label">Final Message</span>
</div>
<div class="investigation with-top-border"> 
    We've proven above that Allah (S.W.T.), the Most Merciful, never brings forth evil to human beings and never wronged sinners.
    We have also proven by showing references that the God of the bible is not singularly righteous as what 1 John 1:5 states. We've shown evidence 
    of verses where the God of the bible commanded to kill women, children, infant, and animals. Further, we've also shown some sex related verses in the bible 
    that is accordingly (as claimed by 2 Timothy 3:16-17) breathed by God.
    <p>
        As a conclusion, if you are a non-Muslim, I hope it is clear to you by now that Allah (S.W.T.) never brings forth evil to us human beings.
        I further conclude that based on the references above, the God of the bible is the bringer of evil. 
        If you disagree, feel free to counter my arguments above.
    </p>
    <p>
        As Allah (S.W.T.) said in Qur'an 7:28 above "<b>Do you say about Allah that which you do not know?</b>". Peace be to you all, Allah (S.W.T.) knows best.
