Whereas the God of the Qur'an brings about both good and evil, the God of the Bible never engages in evil and is singularly righteous (1 John 1:5)

    Is the above statement true?

    <span class="tooltip">Assalamu 'Alaikum!<span class="tooltiptext">Arabic for "Peace be upon you", Muslim greeting.</span></span>
    <span class="tooltip">Alhamdulillah!<span class="tooltiptext">Arabic for "Praise be to God", Muslim common phrase.</span></span> 
    <p>
        If we are to interpret the above statement, it seems to suggest that the God of the Qur'an is not righteous since it also brings evil to 
        human beings. If that's what you believed, then let's investigate the Qur'an if such statement is true.
    </p>
    <p>
        God by definition should be loving and caring, and <b>should never bring forth evil to His creation</b>. However, we need to understand that God created Satan as well.
        Anything evil is of course from Satan and not from God. Further, if God indeed loves us, then He should clearly warned us of Satan.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Islam, everything around us is already well-planned and well-designed according to the will of Allah (S.W.T.), 
        from the very start of creation. So any decision we do is NOT A COINCIDENCE, Allah (S.W.T.) knows ahead of time what our actions would be.
        However, in Islam, despite the decision we made somehow are already programmed, we are also told that, 
        we have our OWN FREE WILL in our decision making. This seems to be difficult to comprehend at first glance,
        since NOT A COINCIDENCE and WITH FREE WILL are better interpreted as mutually exclusive. But, 
        that is indeed possible, in which our FREE WILLED decisions end up to what God actually planned. 
        To have the two (NOT A COINCIDENCE and WITH FREE WILL) to work well together, is one reason what makes Allah (S.W.T.) indeed the one and only true God,
        because those attributes are difficult to maintain or even comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having the above understanding, it suffices to say that Allah brings forth goodness to us and not evil, since it is up to us whether to 
        follow Allah or to follow Satan. Whatever is our decision, is our own free will. If we follow Allah, then goodness is indeed from Him. However,
        if we follow Satan, then there is no any goodness in it, and the absence of goodness is evil.
    </p>
    <p>
        While we believe evil is from Satan, we also need to account that God created him in the first place. Therefore technically, everything 
        we received is indeed from the will of Allah even those from the works of Satan, <b>but as a test</b>. This follows from the fact that God by definition is the creator of everything, including Satan. 
        Caution, don't rush and conclude that Allah brings forth evil through Satan, because in the end,
        Satan has his own free will, his decision is his own and not influenced by Allah (S.W.T.) (though Allah (S.W.T.) knows already the actions of Satan ahead of time).
    </p>
    <p>
        I think the above discussion is enough to conclude that such statement, that Allah brings forth evil, is not true.
        What left for me then, is to dump the verses as proof to the above logic.

                Allah (S.W.T.) created everything including Satan (who does the work of evil and is part of the test to all human beings):

But I had no authority over you except that I invited you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; but blame yourselves. I cannot be called to your aid, nor can you be called to my aid. Indeed, I deny your association of me [with Allah] before. Indeed, for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment." 14|22
    2|168|O mankind, eat from whatever is on earth [that is] lawful and good and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.
2|169|He only orders you to evil and immorality and to say about Allah what you do not know.
2|268|Satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality, while Allah promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.
7|28|And when they commit an immorality, they say, "We found our fathers doing it, and Allah has ordered us to do it." Say, "Indeed, Allah does not order immorality. Do you say about Allah that which you do not know?"
16|90|Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded.
