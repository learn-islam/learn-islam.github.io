Consider the following verses of the Qur’an:
<div class="quran-wrapper">
    <div class="quran-verse">
        <div class="quran">
            ذَٰلِكَ مِنْ أَنۢبَآءِ ٱلْغَيْبِ نُوحِيهِ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يُلْقُونَ أَقْلَٰمَهُمْ أَيُّهُمْ يَكْفُلُ مَرْيَمَ وَمَا كُنتَ لَدَيْهِمْ إِذْ يَخْتَصِمُونَ
        </div>
        <div class="translation">
            That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O Muhammad]. And you were not with them when they cast their pens as to which of them should be responsible for Mary. Nor were you with them when they disputed.

Assalamu `Alaikum to my Muslim and non-Muslim readers! If you are a non-Muslim and asking the same question, welcome brother/sister! May God guide us as we try to
investigate these verses. I want to begin with sincere intention all for the sake of Allah <span class="tooltip">(S.W.T.)<span class="tooltiptext">Subhanahu wa ta'ala, Arabic for "May He be glorified and exalted", Muslim honorific.</span></span>.

    To answer this question, we need to understand why these verses are of interest to our trinitarian brothers. Specifically, we need to understand their belief about Jesus (A.S.) and his role in the doctrine of trinity.
    <div class="question">  
        The most popular belief, promoted by the vast majority of churches in the world, is that God has a triune nature. This is the doctrine known as the Trinity, which defines God as one Being who exists eternally as three distinct persons — the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Put simply, it is "one God in three persons" [1].<br><br>
        The trinitarians believe that Jesus (A.S.) are of the following: 
        <ol>
            <li>He was born miraculously by the virgin Marry;</li>
            <li>He was the Messiah;</li>
            <li>He is a God, specifically the Son of God of the Trinity.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>    
</p>
<p>
    Hence the reason why they pick those Qur'anic verses to support their claim, specifically the first two in the list above. So the question is,
    <div class="question">
        Do we Muslims reject the miraculous birth of Jesus?<br>
        Do we recognize him as the Messiah?<br>
        Do we recognize him as God?
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    These are quite an interesting questions, and that is because Jesus (A.S.) plays a pivotal role on the differences of Christianity and Islam. So interesting that we need to 
    separate it into different blog posts:

    Alhamdulillah! We've finally done it, if something was not clear or if I made a mistake, please do correct me by commenting below. Sincerely, I don't intend to make fun of Christianity and other religions but for us to understand what the Qur'an wants to convey,
    and if you have other questions please don't hesitate to ask me, your questions will also help me understand my own religion. Lastly, to my Muslim brothers, if you have something to add please do inform me below.
