In the name of Allah, the entirely merciful, the especially merciful. Let me begin with the sincerest intention all for the sake of truth. This paper is a compilation of my work on the thesis: The bible says Jesus (A.S.) is God. The content contains bible verses and questions related to the doctrine of trinity. 
<p>
    The life of Jesus (A.S.) plays a pivotal role to both Christianity and Islam. The two religions believe Jesus (A.S.) as the Messiah sent by Allah (God) to the children of Israel. His divinity is the core belief of the majority of the Christian denominations around the world, but is rejected by the Qur'an (the holy book of Islam). So, the main question is, is Jesus (A.S.) God?
</p>
<p>
    I do appreciate this opportunity for giving me the chance to ask questions. Most of these are products of my research for the past few months. I have no problem if I don’t get any answer, so don’t be pressured, because all I want is for the readers of this paper to see my questions. However, if you intend to answer, then that would be great. Your answer will help me find the verses addressing the questions. I numbered the questions, so that readers who intend to answer can use these numbers as their reference to the question. 
</p>
<p>
    I keep on saying this, but just to be clear, I respect all religions and I don’t care what you believed in. As a Muslim, my presence and your presence are enough reminder already from God to both of us, that is, it’s up to us to look into the belief of other faiths. Having said, some of the questions I have here are sensitive. I compiled these for those who are interested only, and I don’t intend to make fun of Christianity or any religion. 
</p>
<p>
    In case you don’t know, we Muslims believe Judaism and Christianity as heavenly religions, that is, we believe on the revelations given to Moses (A.S.) and Jesus (A.S.). However, we don’t know if these messages were preserved, maybe some of it, but we don’t know which one for sure. The only thing that we are sure of is that Moses (A.S.), Jesus (A.S.) and all prophets taught the absolute oneness of God; and the Qur’an was revealed as a criterion over the previous scriptures. 
</p>
<p>
    As the title of this paper says, all questions I listed here are directly related to doctrine of trinity. The other questions, which I also want to present, are on topics such as: atonement of sins, crucifixion, followers of Jesus (A.S.), and the bible as a holy book. I prefer to put the topics in separate articles for organizational purposes. Lastly, investigating something or seeking for the truth is not one sided, because a Judge won’t just listen to or question one party and assume the other one as innocent. He clearly needs to check and study the statements of the parties involved. Therefore, I encourage my readers to question my religion (sensitive or not, advanced or basic), I love to see the perspective of other faiths (my email: alasaadstat@gmail.com). Thank you again for this opportunity, take your time, like I said don’t be pressured. Seeking for the truth is not based on how quick I received the answers, but rather on how to be guided and get the right answers.
</p>
<p>
    Peace be with you all, AL Asaad.

                Christianity taught us that Jesus (A.S.) is a mediator (see 1 Timothy 2:5) between God and men, that is, we cannot worship God directly, because according to Jesus (A.S.) “. . .no one comes to the Father except through me” (see John 14:6). If that is the case, why would he say/agree to worship the Father (directly without mediator?) and serve the Father only?

                I’m not trying to make a conclusion, but correct me if I’m wrong. From the above verse, it seems to be very risky to add/associate a partner to the Father, for He is a jealous God, isn’t it? And if we do so, He will destroy us off from the face of the earth?

                    Additional verse where Jesus (A.S.) commands us to worship the Father when we pray are given in the following verses:

                            And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, "Which commandment is the most important of all?" Jesus answered, "The most important is, Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. 'The second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these." And the scribe said to him, "You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that he is one, and there is no other besides him. And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices." And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions.

            If trinity is indeed what the bible teaches and that Jesus (A.S.) is part of the triune God, shouldn't Jesus (A.S.) reject the absolute oneness of God, and instead clarify and teach that God is part of the trinity? The shema which is the phrase "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one" (see Deuteronomy 6:4) is the core belief of the Jews, and they recite this several times in a day in their prayers. In Islam, this is equivalent to kalima which is the most powerful statement in Islam, the statement is: "There is no god but Allah (God)". Some Christian apologists argue that the word "one" in the shema is a complex unity, I will reserve my discussion on that, in a separate paper. The fact that Jews and Muslims are praying to the same one God, and that Jesus (A.S.) is a Jew, shouldn't we worship his God alone?

                This verse seems to suggest that, if trinity did exist, then according to this explicit statement by Jesus (A.S.), the other godheads associated to the Father are not true gods.

                If the atonement of sins is the sacrifice of Jesus (A.S.) because that's what the old testament says (see Leviticus 17:11) accordingly, then can we also use the old testament to check as to who God is? I’ve read Matthew and Mark, and still working on Luke, with few chapters on John, but if you read the Gospels, from Matthew to John, Jesus (A.S.) is also called the Son of Man, for example Matthew 8:20, Mark 2:10, Luke 5:24, John 3:13, etc. Therefore, if Jesus (A.S.) is the Son of Man, then why does the old testament say that God is not a man or a Son of Man?

                I once attended a mass at a Christian church and I also learned this from one of the bible study I attended, at one point of the session I heard the speaker saying, that we are all sinners and we cannot uphold the law --- the ten commandments. From doing research, I found out that the reason is due to the writings of Paul, where he emphasized that we cannot be saved by keeping the law, or good works, but through faith in Jesus (A.S.), who accordingly is God. See the verse below on why we cannot uphold the law according to Paul, (see also this link)

                Therefore, according to Paul we cannot be saved by keeping the law, but by faith in Jesus (A.S.), for the law accordingly brings wrath; and if we were to base our righteousness through the law, then Christ died for no purpose. Hence, we cannot uphold the law including the first commandment which to uphold the absolute oneness of God. If that is the case, then why (this time) according to Jesus (A.S.) (not Paul) that, he did not come to abolish the law and instead fulfill it?

                Why would Paul relaxes the law when Jesus (A.S.) said not to? I do respect what Christians believe, but who should I follow, Jesus (A.S.) or Paul? Further, I also don’t understand, honestly, why most Christians eat pork? Isn't it prohibited in the law to eat it? From what we have above, according to Jesus (A.S.) not Paul, that by eating pork will relax the law.

                This verse suggests that, if I stick to the will of the Father by following His law, then Jesus (A.S.) will acknowledge me on the day of judgement. Otherwise (by abolishing the law), I will be among the workers of lawlessness?

                Again, the common argument I learned is that, we are all sinners and we cannot uphold the law as taught by Paul not Jesus (A.S.). Hence, according to the teachings of Paul, we need Jesus (A.S.) as atonement for our sins. However, by definition, we know that God is omniscient and wise, why would he give the law and then later found out (accordingly) that we cannot uphold it? Isn't God not a son of man, that he should change his mind according to Numbers 23:19? Isn't God supposed to not change according to Malachi 3:6? Why would he even change from 1 to 3 in 1?

                According to Christianity, God died for our sins. If that is the case, I honestly don’t understand how can God die? If God died during crucifixion, then who is in charge ,of the world and the heavens? From what I read, the common response here is that God did not die, but only the human part of him. However, if that is the case, then why would they say God died for our sins in the first place if he didn’t?

                If Jesus (A.S.) is not knowledgeable about his return, as in the previous question in reference to Matthew 24:36, because from what I learned is that, the common argument to address this question is due to fact that Jesus (A.S) is both man and god. If that is the case, then we should at least expect Jesus (A.S.) to be God when we need him to, and be man when he has to. Salvation accordingly is through him; I’m sorry, I don’t intend to be rude (I warned you this is sensitive), but shouldn't he at least make it clear to us that he is God? Because it is a matter of living in paradise or hell eternally. Miracles can be used as a proof, but previous prophets did miracles too, and they were sent by God the same as Jesus (A.S.); and even if the miracles were enough proofs, how are we going to reconcile what Jesus (A.S.) said about the only true God, who according to him is the Father (John 17:3)? Let me give an example, (again, I apologize, but I’m trying to express this in a respectful manner, I don’t intend to be judgmental, the fact that I studied and spent time reading the bible, simply suggest that I didn’t judged it by what people says) if someone attempts to run for presidency, the candidate shouldn't do body language or implied messages for us to assume that he will run for president. He clearly needs to go to the stage and declare it to the public. The same situation when you doubt someone, say in a relationship (e.g. your child in love with someone, or your relationship with God, etc.). You wouldn't feel at peace if your partner (e.g. the one courting your child, or your God) is beating around the bus without giving direct commitment. What I’m trying to respectfully say is, if Jesus (A.S.) is God, the basic assumption I expect is that he himself have declared it. If so, can you guide me as to where it is in the bible where he says "I am God"? Obviously, I looked into it and surfed the web. The findings I found is that, there is none in the bible, just as the word "bible" or “trinity” not found in the bible. However, the word bible simply refers to the holy book of Christianity, you can name the book anything you want; and the word “trinity” simply refers to the 3 godheads in 1 essence. The name is not important, what is important is the definition. For example, you cannot find the word “Doctor” in the Japanese books, but you can find the definition of it, and you say “Doctor” is in the Japanese books because it has the same definition as the word “Ishi” (医師). Therefore, if Jesus (A.S.) is God and is part of the trinity, what is the definition do we expect? Of course, Jesus (A.S.) should have said, “I am God, part of the 3 godheads (the father, the son, and the holy spirit) in 1 essence, and you should worship me”. If I may refer to our analogy before respectfully, what matters to us as listeners, is for someone whom we want to support to at least declare that he will run for president. Further, if Jesus (A.S.) is both man and god, where is the foundation of this in the bible? Is there any verse declaring this so that we don’t have to make assumptions and to remove confusions? However, we have seen already from Numbers 23:19, that God is not a man or a Son of Man. This question was raised in the Qur’an in the following verse:

                I know, I use the Qur’an here despite the fact that Christians don’t believe in it. I respect my non-Muslim readers, but I’m a Muslim, so this should be no surprise, unless I’m a Christian already. The question being posted here does make a point, (I’m not trying to be biased, but honestly it does make a point). So did Jesus (A.S.) say “I am God and you should worship me”? If there is a verse, then at least we have an evidence to present to God in the day of judgement, if in case Jesus (A.S.) will disassociate himself from us. Now if you say, God will not ask us because that statement is from the Qur’an, and because the Qur’an is not acknowledged by the Christians, hence one might conclude that it won’t happen. But there is a “what if?” isn’t it? There is a hole, so do we have something to present if in case?

                If salvation is achieved by believing in the doctrine of trinity (that is, claiming Jesus (A.S.) as God), why would Jesus (A.S.) say that, salvation is from the Jews? Or in other words, why would he say salvation is achieved by upholding the law (that is, God is one and have no partners)?

                The verse is an interesting one, and it is almost explicitly stated. I’m trying not to be biased, although for Christians, this is explicitly stated already. The reason follows from the fact that, the other verses I presented seems to be not supporting this verse. Not supporting if we think that Jesus (A.S.) and the Father as “one being”. Let me site an example again, if the vice-president says he and the president are one, wouldn’t it simply suggest that they are one in purpose/mission? Unless the vice-president says he and the president are “one being”, then that is very explicit. How then are we going to understand the meaning/context of this verse? Of course, by looking at other verses. If they are one as in “one being”, then some verses in the bible will be affected and hard to understand. For example, when Jesus (A.S.) needs the help of God as in Luke 22:42, he prayed to the Father; another in Matthew 27:46 and Mark 15:34, he called God. Again, if I were to say these, I would do it in a respectful manner, that if Jesus (A.S.) and God are “one being”, was Jesus (A.S.) praying to himself then? Was he calling himself? And how can God pray? Isn’t God self-sufficient? Isn’t God not a Son of Man (Numbers 23:19)? Isn’t God invisible (1 Timothy 1:17)? 
                <p>
                    Further, if we are to agree on that verse believing that Jesus (A.S.) and the Father as “one being”, where is the holy spirit, shouldn’t the three of them one? Is there a verse where it says Jesus (A.S.) and the holy spirit are one? And is there a verse where it says the Father and the holy spirit are one? Also, what about the other succeeding verses where Jesus (A.S.) talks about his disciples to God?

Sincerely, shouldn’t these verses be interpreted in this way: that these verses simply suggest that Jesus (A.S.) is referring to one purpose or one mission with the Father, and that is to worship the Father only and follow His prophets?

                From the above verses, the doctrine of trinity is honestly difficult to understand, even according to a Christian apologist Dr. James White (if you have watched debates between Muslim and Christian, you should know this guy very well. He recently debated with Bro. Joe Ventilacion of Iglesia ni Cristo), where he wrote,
                <p>
                    “For many Christians, the Trinity is an abstract principle, a confusing and difficult doctrine that they believe, although they are not really sure why in their honest moments.” - James White, “Loving the Trinity,” Christian Research Journal, vol. 21, no. 22. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is just my honest opinion, but I think the main reason is because the above verses do not follow trinity. It is confusing to be honest as Dr. White write for most Christians, and I have asked a couple of Christians already, those whom I can bravely asked straightforward. I also looked into debates about this, but still confusing. I tried to understand it and unify it with the above verses, but still most Christians I asked don’t also understand it as well. For some, they tend to look at it as a mystery, but that is hard/difficult to simply agree or accept in that state --- mystery (believed upon by many) without understanding. Especially, when it is the core belief and is being taught in the church. It won’t make someone at peace if something is difficult to understand, maybe for some they can stand it, but I’m one of those who are not at peace, believing something without understanding (in all honesty). However, according to the bible, God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.

                According to Albert Einstein which I agree on is that, “Peace cannot be kept by force. It only be achieved through understanding”. It cannot be kept by force, that is, force by waging war; or force by simply believing without understanding. Further, another quote from this scientist which I also agree on is that, “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough”.

                    While religion encourages believers to have faith even though we don’t understand some of the teachings, or even the fact that we haven’t seen the characters of the bible. I think (just my personal opinion), what is important, is to at least make sure that by having faith, the risk is very small or close to none. From the above verses, it suggest that, upholding the belief on the absolute oneness of God (pure monotheism), as stated in the law, will at least secure a believer, because that's what Jesus (A.S.) taught (see Mark 12:28-34 and John 17:3) us. On the other hand, associating God with a partner places a risk and makes things confusing; and it seems to be a huge risk as God repeatedly warn us about this, see for example the following the verses below:

                            Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: “I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god. Who is like me? Let him proclaim it. Let him declare and set it before me, since I appointed an ancient people. Let them declare what is to come, and what will happen. Fear not, nor be afraid; have I not told you from of old and declared it? And you are my witnesses! Is there a God besides me? There is no Rock; I know not any.”
