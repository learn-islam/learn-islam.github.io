The Christian belief is that Jesus (A.S.) died for the sins of all humanity. That is, the Messiah is supposed to be the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin; in other words, a human sacrifice.

                Is human sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin, why God (the Father) disagree to this when Moses wants to offer himself as atonement for his peaple?

                            The next day Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps <span class="emphasize">I can make atonement for your sin</span>." So Moses returned to the Lord and said, "Alas, this people has sinned a great sin. They have made for themselves gods of gold. But now, if you will forgive their sin—but if not, <span class="emphasize">please blot me out of your book that you have written</span>." But the Lord said to Moses, "<span class="emphasize">Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book</span>. But now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you; behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, <span class="emphasize">in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them</span>." Then the Lord sent a plague on the people, because they made the calf, the one that Aaron made.

                In one of my dialogue with our Christian brothers, I asked them "is blood sacrifice the ONLY WAY for the forgiveness of sin?" and they replied "Yes". At that time, I haven't read much of the old testament. So I was very curious to verify their claim, until I found the above verse, which clearly shows why atonement through human sacrifice of one person for the sins of the other is not something God (the Father) emphasized. In fact, God (the Father) went the other way around and says "<b>Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book</b>". In other words, the one who sinned against the Father is the one whom the Father will charge.

                Christianity taught us that if someone sinned, that sin can only be removed through the sacrifice of Jesus (A.S.) because the Father is so righteous that we cannot be with Him because we are all sinners. Having this understanding, why would the Father emphasize that the one who committed the sin is the one who shall be put to death, not a substitute like Jesus (A.S.).

                The first sentence of the above verse is so powerful, that one person cannot be put to death for the sins of the other. The second sentence further expound this with the Father saying "<b>Each one shall be put to death for his own sin</b>".

                If the above verses are not yet convincing, then below are the verses where the Father went on to elaborate on this topic.

                All Christians I engaged emphasized that good works is not enough or will not erase the sins committed by the person. In fact, at one point of my dialogue with them, they asked me in Tagalog "kaya mo bang bayaran kasalanan mo?" (can you afford to pay for your sins?), I responded in Tagalog "ihihinto ko lang yung masamang gawain at gumawa ng kabutihan" (I will simply stop the bad works I do and do more good works). Unfortunately, good deeds accordingly is not enough. However, the Father emphasized above the following contrary to what I learned from the Christians: <i>“But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins that he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, <b>he shall surely live; he shall not die. None of the transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness that he has done he shall live</b></i>. Having this command from God (the Father), simply suggest that human sacrifice is not necessary for the forgiveness of sins, but rather stopping bad deeds and do good deeds, which make a lot of sense.

                Again, this same principle is stated in the Book of Jeremiah. In the 31st chapter, God (the Father) tells of a time in the future when no one will continue to believe in such a thing.
