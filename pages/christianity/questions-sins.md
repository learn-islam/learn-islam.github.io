The Christian belief is that Jesus (A.S.) died for the sins of all humanity. That is, the Messiah is supposed to be the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin; in other words, a human sacrifice.

                Is human sacrifice necessary for forgiveness of sin, why God (the Father) disagree to this when Moses wants to?

                            The next day Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps <span class="emphasize">I can make atonement for your sin</span>." So Moses returned to the Lord and said, "Alas, this people has sinned a great sin. They have made for themselves gods of gold. But now, if you will forgive their sin—but if not, <span class="emphasize">please blot me out of your book that you have written</span>." But the Lord said to Moses, "<span class="emphasize">Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book</span>. But now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you; behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, <span class="emphasize">in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them</span>." Then the Lord sent a plague on the people, because they made the calf, the one that Aaron made.
