Christianity can be categorized into two major groups: Unitarian and Trinitarian. The former follows the belief that God is 
One and that Jesus (A.S.) is not God but is the Messiah. The latter, on the other hand, believed Jesus (A.S.) as the Messiah
and is God, and follows the doctrine of Trinity which states that, the Father, the Son (Jesus (A.S.)), and the Holy Spirit are Gods, co-equal, distinct and are one.
<br><br>
Followers of unitarian doctrines can be traced back to the early christians, such as the Ebionites (see my discussions), who were
Jews but believed Jesus (A.S.) as the Messiah and not God. Modern unitarians include, Christadelphian and Jehovah's Witness. Trinitarians, on the other hand, can be futher categorized into Catholics and Protestant.
<br><br>
The books they believed is the Holy Bible, which contains both the old testament and new testament. The old testament
is the copy of the Jewish bible, and the new testament contains the Gospel of Jesus and the writings of Paul.
