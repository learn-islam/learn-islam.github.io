<p>In this page, we will discuss what Christianity is, as a religion. The presentation proceeds with a summarized version on the belief of the said religion, but will also provide dedicated pages on the details of the main items mentioned.</p>

<p>Christianity can be categorized into two major groups: Unitarian and Trinitarian. The former follows the belief that God is 
One and that Jesus (A.S.) is not God but is the Messiah. The latter, on the other hand, believed Jesus (A.S.) as the Messiah
and is God, and follows the doctrine of Trinity which states that, the Father, the Son — Jesus (A.S.) — and the Holy Spirit are Gods, co-equal, distinct and are one.</p>
<p>
Followers of Unitarian doctrines can be traced back to the early christians, such as the Ebionites (see my discussions), who were
Jews but believe Jesus (A.S.) as The Messiah and not God. Modern Unitarians include, Christadelphian and Jehovah's Witness. Trinitarians, on the other hand, can be futher categorized into Catholics and Protestant.
</p>
<p>The holy book of they refer to is the Bible, which contains both the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament is the copy of the Jewish Bible, and the New Testament contains the Gospel of Jesus and the writings of Paul.</p>
<p>
There are a number of items under Trinitarian doctrine, and it is important for us to discuss these to better understand their beliefs.
