<p>In this page, we will discuss what Christianity is as a religion. The presentation will proceed with a summarized version on the belief of the said religion, but will also provide dedicated pages on the details of the main items that will be mentioned.</p>
<div class="section-wrapper">
    <span class="section-label">Nature of God</span>
</div>
<div class="with-top-border">    
Christianity can be categorized into two major groups: Unitarian and Trinitarian. The former follows the belief that God is 
One and that Jesus (A.S.) is not a God but is the Messiah. The latter, on the other hand, believed Jesus (A.S.) as the Messiah
and is a God, and follows the doctrine of Trinity which states that, the Father, the Son --- Jesus (A.S.) --- and the Holy Spirit are Gods, co-equal, distinct and are one.
<p>
Trinitarians justify the concept of the Trinity through verses like Genesis 1:26 and Matthew 28:19. Further, they also justify the divinity of Jesus (A.S.) through the miracles depicted in the New Testament, and through the statement "I am" from John 8:58, which they say is a fulfillment of the Exodus 3:14.
</p>
Unitarians, on the other hand, justify their claim of Oneness of God through verses like Deuteronomy 6:4, Isaiah 45:5-6, etc. In addition, they also support this with New Testament verses like John 17:3, Mark 12:28-34, etc.
</div>
<div class="section-wrapper">
    <span class="section-label">Original Sin</span>
</div>
<div class="with-top-border">    
Trinitarian Christians emphasizes heavily on the role of sin. In particular, they believe in the concept of Original Sin, which states that we are all sinners because we inherited this from our first ancestor, Adam and Eve (may peace be with them), who committed the first sin. This sin, accordingly, are present from the day we were born, and can only be removed through atonement.
</div>
<div class="section-wrapper">
    <span class="section-label">Atonement of Sin</span>
</div>
<div class="with-top-border">    
Sins can be atoned through blood sacrifice only, according to Trinitarians. This is the ruling, accordingly, in the Old Testament (see Leviticus 17:11). Moreover, in order to atone all the sins of all humankind, someone should sacrifice a blood. Not blood of the animals, but someone who is sinless. According to Trinitarians, only Jesus (A.S.) was appropriate for the job. Thus, the crucifiction, accordingly, meant to do just that --- to atone all of us.
</div>
<div class="section-wrapper">
    <span class="section-label">Crucifiction</span>
</div>
<div class="with-top-border">   
The crucifiction of Jesus (A.S.), accordingly, is an act of obedience of Jesus (A.S.) to his Father. Sacrificing himself for all sins of humanity, which in turn makes us all righteous, or have a ticket already to get close to God the Father, who is the Most Righteous.
</div>
<div class="section-wrapper">
    <span class="section-label">Denominations</span>
</div>
<div class="with-top-border">   
Christianity has the most number of denominations among all other religions. It started with Catholic, then splitted to Protestant, then within Protestant there were several further splits. One key emphasis on the belief of the Trinitarian Protestant is that, they justified their belief from the fact that <i>righteousness is not based on work but based on faith</i> (<i>see</i> for example Philippians 3:9), which is not emphasized Catholics.
</div>
<div class="section-wrapper">
    <span class="section-label">Holy Books</span>
</div>
<div class="with-top-border">   
The Holy Books used by the Christians, is the Bible, consisting of the Old Testament and the New Testament. The said compilation of books, were divinely inspired.
</div>
<div class="section-wrapper">
    <span class="section-label">Practice</span>
</div>
<div class="with-top-border">   
The difference between Christian denominations is mainly on practice apart from others who differ on the Nature of God (Absolutely One or Trinity or others?). These practice include, not eating pork while other denominations eat, etc.
</div>
<div class="section-wrapper">
    <span class="section-label">St. Paul</span>
</div>
<div class="with-top-border">   
St. Paul is by far the most popular Christian convert, his writing are heavily used as reference for most Christians. Most Christian nowadays are referred to as Pauline Christians, since the other movement in the early days of Christians, such as Nazareth Christians, etc. were considered heretics and did not propagate into popularity.
