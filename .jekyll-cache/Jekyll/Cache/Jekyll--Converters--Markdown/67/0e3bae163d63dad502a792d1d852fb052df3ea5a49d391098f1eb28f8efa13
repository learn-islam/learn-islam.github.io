Christianity can be categorized into two major groups: Unitarian and Trinitarian. The former follows the belief that God is 
One and that Jesus (A.S.) is not God but is the Messiah. The latter, on the other hand, believed Jesus (A.S.) as the Messiah
and is God, and follows the doctrine of Trinity which states that, the Father, the Son --- Jesus (A.S.) --- and the Holy Spirit are Gods, co-equal, distinct and are one.
<p>
Trinitarians supported the concept of the Trinity through verses like Genesis 1:26 and Matthew 28:19. Further, they also support the divinity of Jesus (A.S.) through the miracles depicted in the New Testament, and through the statement "I am" from John 8:58, which they say is a fulfillment of the Exodus 3:14.
</p>
Unitarians, on the other hand, supported their claim of Oneness of God through verses like Deuteronomy 6:4, Isaiah 45:5-6, etc. In addition, they also support this with New Testament verses like John 17:3, Mark 12:28-34, etc.

<p>The holy book of they refer to is the Bible, which contains both the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament is the copy of the Jewish Bible, and the New Testament contains the Gospel of Jesus and the writings of Paul.</p>

<p>
There are a number of items under Trinitarian doctrine, and it is important for us to discuss these to better understand their beliefs.
