Christianity can be categorized into two major groups: Unitarian and Trinitarian. The former follows the belief that God is 
One and that Jesus (A.S.) is not God but is the Messiah. The latter, on the other hand, believed Jesus (A.S.) as the Messiah
and is God, and follows the doctrine of Trinity which states that, the Father, the Son --- Jesus (A.S.) --- and the Holy Spirit are Gods, co-equal, distinct and are one.
